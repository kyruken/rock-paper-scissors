# rock-paper-scissors
SAISHOU WA GU... JAN... KEN.... GUUUUUUUU - Gon from Hunter x Hunter

Purpose of this project is to create a working rock-paper-scissors program with javascript.
I learned about eventAddListeners, querySelectors, and getElementbyId through creating
this rock-paper-scissors program.

Some trouble I had:
- Creating buttons that returned something, and using that something to give a result
- Changing text of existing html elements through Javascript

The features of this project include:

1. Working rock-paper-scissor buttons that return an element ID based on the button clicked
2. Randomly chosen choice of rock-paper-scissors from a computer
3. Dynamic showing of the computer's choice 
4. Dynamic scoreboard that changes the score of the player and computer based on the choice
of the player and the choice of the computer
